    <h3 class="card-title">Chris Bergeron</h3>
    <h4 class="card-title">Head Coach</h4>
        <p class="card-text">Miami University Director of Athletics David Sayler chose Chris Bergeron to be the sixth head coach in Miami hockey history on April 5, 2019.</p>
        <p class="card-text">In his first season trying to restore the hockey program to the perch he helped it reach in his prior stint as an assistant, Bergeron and his new staff upped the competitiveness of the RedHawks within their contests down the stretch. While a lack of depth led to an overall 8-21-5 record, the RedHawks found themselves at least within a goal, if not leading or ahead in the third period in 15 of their final 25 contests.</p>
        <p class="card-text">He then spent seven years playing professionally before returning to Miami as an assistant coach. During that time, he played with the Adirondack Red Wings (AHL), the Birmingham Bulls (ECHL), the Toledo Storm (ECHL), the Cincinnati Cyclones (IHL) and the Columbus Cottonmouths (CHL), being named a league all-star four times. He also has coaching experience at the professional level, having served as a player/assistant coach with the Port Huron Bordercats of the United Hockey League for two seasons.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Bergeron earned a bachelor's degree in education from Miami.</p>

      <h6 class="card-title">Associate Head Coach</h6>
        <p class="card-text">Miami University head hockey coach Chris Bergeron made his first staffing hire by bringing in Barry Schutte as associate head coach prior to the 2019-20 season.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Schutte stayed with Bergeron after spending nine years on staff with him at Bowling Green. He will work with Miami’s offense while also spearheading the RedHawks’ recruiting efforts.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Individually, three Miami skaters recorded 31 or more points after nobody cleared 26 points a season ago. That included the formation of a dynamic top line in Gordie Green (36 points), Karch Bachman (31 points) and Casey Gilling (31 points), who posted just 25, 16 and 12 points respectively the year before.</p>

      <h6 class="card-title">Associate Head Coach</h6>
        <p class="card-text">Miami University head hockey coach Chris Bergeron rounded out his coaching staff with the addition of Eric Rud as associate head coach prior to the 2019-20 season.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Rud comes to Oxford after spending the past five seasons as the head coach of St. Cloud State’s women’s hockey program. He previously served as an assistant coach at both the NCAA men’s and USHL levels of the sport. Rud works with the RedHawks’ defense, a unit that saw several underclassmen log heavy minutes on the blue line in his first campaign in Oxford.</p>

      <h6 class="card-title">Director Of Hockey Operations</h6>
        <p class="card-text">Head hockey coach Chris Bergeron brought Jimmy Spratt in to join his staff as the Director of Hockey Operations. Spratt spent five seasons at Bowling Green State University in the same role prior to arriving in Oxford.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Spratt is a former netminder at BGSU from 2005 to 2009. Over his time as a Falcon, Spratt accumulated over 5,500 minutes of action between the pipes. Spratt totaled a 3.45 goals-against average and made 2,441 saves in 100 appearances. Spratt also accounted for three shutouts in a single season, tying the mark for the most shutouts in a single season for a Falcon goaltender.</p>
